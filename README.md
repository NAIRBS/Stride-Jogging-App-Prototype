# Welcome to Stride Jogging App Prototype Repository

This was originally an academic project to develop a mobile application.<br>
Although this was completed quite some time ago, Stride originally had these features (the dependencies and APIs have expired...)

* Google Map API -> Geofencing and Location tracking
* Pedometer -> Keep track of number of steps.
* Stopwatch -> Timer and Count Down functions.
* Progress -> Keeps track of various user data.
* Music -> Plays Music
